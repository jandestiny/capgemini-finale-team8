# capgemini-finale-team8

To start the project, install the neede npm modules with "npm i" and run the server with "node server.js"

The goal with this project is to create a type of "IOT Social Network", where all Sensors and other connected data sources create "posts" based on their sensed data.
Each post is described with a hashtag and every hashtag can be followed/subscribed by either users i.e. real humans OR by machines! E.g. the air conditioning system or automated windows.

All of the posts are visible in a combined feed, where you can either see all posts or only your "subscribed" topics.

That way, humans can literally read about whats happening in the smart office in real time and have it visualized in a familiar, modern way.
